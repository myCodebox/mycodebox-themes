# myCodebox-themes README

Since the ATOM.io project is discontinued and there is no suitable VS code theme (I love Paríso), I decided to create my own theme.

I would like to thank [idleberg](https://github.com/idleberg/atom-paraiso-dark) for his Atom theme implementation and of course also [Rubens LP](https://www.rubenslp.com.br/) for its beautiful colors. 👋
