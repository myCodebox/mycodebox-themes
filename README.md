# myCodebox-themes README

![Banner](./src/banner.jpg)

Since the ATOM.io project is discontinued and there is no suitable VS code theme (I love Paríso), I decided to create my own theme.

I would like to thank [idleberg](https://github.com/idleberg/atom-paraiso-dark) for its Atom theme implementation and of course also [Rubens LP](https://www.rubenslp.com.br/) for its beautiful colors. 👋

Special thanks to ⭐🥓 **@THomas** 🥓⭐ for his feedback!

## The issues 🐞
Not all colors are set yet and there are still places where I currently have no idea how to test it. But they are still coming.
